todo queue:

	- huge change: data hours instead of data days
	- some checking of loaded data, serialization?
	
some other considered stuff:
	
	- not having to alloc every packet

not worth it:

	- RoutingEntry linked list (not worth it)

DONE:
	- queue things to implement:
		- remove nth elem
		- put element to front
	- DataDays linked list
	- Packets linked list
	- RX & TX packet queues
