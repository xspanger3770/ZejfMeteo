# ZejfMeteo

ZejfMeteo is a command-line program written entirely in C, which enables the recording and storage of data from various sensors, each with different sampling rates.

At present, ZejfMeteo supports USB and TCP connections to receive data and communicate with various devices through custom protocol.

The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a GUI application that can connect to this TCP server and present the data in real-time, 
along with a history of previous data making it easy to build custom and easily expandable meteostations at home by anyone.
