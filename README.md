# ZejfMeteo
Command line tool and API for my homemade meteostation project

Work in progress...

Similar concept to [ZejfSeis](https://github.com/xspanger3770/ZejfSeis): A server is collecting and storing data from various sensors connected using USB or Wi-Fi.

Sensors are running on Raspberry Pi Pico boards and the code can be found in `core/` folder.

A Java application will be used to display and browse the data using charts and statistics. The code is in `viewer/` folder.
